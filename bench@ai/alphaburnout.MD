## GPU training:

After successful setup of CUDA and cuDNN, import the following in python:

```python
from ai_benchmark import AIBenchmark

benchmark = AIBenchmark()
results = benchmark.run()
```

and you are good to go. There's a leaderboard / ranking system to analyze benchmark results [here](https://burnout-benchmark.com/)ðŸŒ¸
