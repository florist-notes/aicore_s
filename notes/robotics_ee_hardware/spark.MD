# Sensing, Perception, Autonomy, and Robot Kinetics


+ MIT-SPARK/Kimera [ @[github](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera) ] : Kimera is a C++ library for real-time metric-semantic simultaneous localization and mapping, which uses camera images and inertial data to build a semantically annotated 3D mesh of the environment. Kimera is modular, ROS-enabled, and runs on a CPU.
